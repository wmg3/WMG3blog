**# #SS Numbers need to go away# #** 

According to this article in Bloomberg today -The White Hose and Equifax have determined that SS numbers are no longer the best way to identify people. 
[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-03/white-house-and-equifax-agree-social-security-numbers-should-go](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-03/white-house-and-equifax-agree-social-security-numbers-should-go "Article Here")

This will usher in a new kind of identifier which may be the **Mark of the Beast** spoken about in the **Bible**. 

This new identifier will most likely be a data store which will be attached to a person body. 

Advantages to this type of system: 

1. The data will be owned/managed by the person and cannot be stolen
2. The data will not be stored outside the individual or if it is it will be encrypted and only be unlock able by the individual
3. Data can only be used by the owner due to individual bio metric authentication
4. Storage of data may be Decentralized (Stored on/in individuals)

If this system is "The Mark of the Beast" then it will include a component which requires the person taking the mark to be a follower/worshiper of the "Beast" or "AntiChrist". AntiChrist following ultimately leads to eternal damnation and should not be taken by Jesus Followers. This will be a huge disadvantage to those who wish to remain faithful to the true Christ.
