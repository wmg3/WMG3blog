# How I save $1000.00 a year on mobile phone charges #


----------
Here's a quick comparison between my phone bill and my wife's phone bill: 

**Wife**
	
	- AT&T Service
	- 5GB Data plan
	- $99.00 /Mo.

**Me**
	
	- Republic Wireless Service
	- No Data plan
	- $15.00 /Mo.

Ok. So I realize this is not apples to apples comparison.

First, My wife's phone installment payment is included in her bill but even without that, her bill would still be about $50.00-$65.00/Mo.

Second, I realize I get no mobile data with my plan but I am rarely in a location that doesn't have WiFi so I don't really miss that.

On the other hand my service with Republic Wireless has some advantages: 

	1. No additional charges for overages
	2. WiFi calling when available (Usually better voice quality)
	3. I still get text and Voice on a major carrier (Republic uses the Sprint Network)
